<h3 class="h3"><u>In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, here are some intresting facts that one might not know about him :</u></h3>
<ul style="background-color: rgb(155, 150, 151);">
    <li>Gandhi was not the best student. Although he was known for being highly ethical with good English skills, he was considered a mediocre student in math and poor in Geography. He also had bad handwriting, which he was embarrassed about.</li>
    <li>Gandhi was a teenage newlywed. He was only 13 years old when he married his 14-year-old bride Kasturba in 1882. The young couple weren't too fond of each other but later found common ground. The death of their first child made him a strong opponent of child marriage.</li>
    <li>Gandhi spoke English like an Irishman. (One of his first English teachers was from Ireland.)</li>
    <li>Gandhi's civil disobedience was inspired by American Transcendentalist <a id="Henry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" target ="_blank">Henry David Thoreau</a>, whose famous essay "Civil Disobedience," he read while he was in prison.</li>
    <li>Gandhi's activism started in South Africa. Having a hard time finding work as a lawyer in India, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893, where he was given legal work through an Indian firm. It was there that he and his fellow Indians encountered constant discrimination by the Dutch and the British, which in turn, inspired him to fight for their rights. During his time in South Africa, where he was imprisoned many times, he developed his concept of peaceful resistance and "satyagraha" (firmness in truth).</li>
    <li>In 1930 Gandhi became the first and only Indian (so far) who has been distinguished with the "Time Person of the Year" title.</li>
    <li>Gandhi never won a Nobel Peace Prize, despite being nominated five times. In 2006 the committee publicly admitted its regret at having never honored him with the award.</li>
    <li>Gandhi didn't like his photograph taken, yet he became the most photographed person of his era.</li>
    <li>Gandhi and <a ID="LEO" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" target="_blank">Leo Tolstoy</a> regularly corresponded with each other.</li>
    <li>Among Gandhi's many admirers were <a id="einstein" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target= "_blank">Albert Einstein</a> and <a id="ford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" target="_blank"> Ford</a>.</li>
    <li>Gandhi wrote a letter to <a id="Hitler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" target="_blank"> Hitler</a>, addressing him as "Dear Friend," and beseeched him to stop the war. Hitler never wrote back.</li>
    <li>Gandhi's funeral procession was almost 5 miles long.</li>
